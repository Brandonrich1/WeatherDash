# WeatherDash

# Weatherapp
This is my WeatherDash that uses the OpenWeather API to fetch the data for whatever city's weather you want.
this is done when you enter the city in the "Search Citits" field and the button is clicked.
The api is fetched and returned with that cities name, date and time, the current humidity in %, current temp, and an icon that describes the weather at that time.
the data is that is fetched is only for that day and not for a 5 day weather forecast. 
feel free to search as many cities as you want. if you ever want to quickly go back to a city's weather you already searched you can click on the city's name in the history tab to instantly search again.
